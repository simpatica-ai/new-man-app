Found that it fetches Stage 1 AI prompts from 'https://getstage1-917009769018.us-central1.run.app' endpoint, but the user mentioned the prompt file is at '/Users/bwenzlau/Projects/getstage1/index.js'. The page uses fetchStage1Prompt function that makes HTTP requests to the cloud function.","Examined the Stage 1 prompt file. It's a Google Cloud Function that uses Vertex AI to generate prompts. The function appears to be properly structured with error handling and fallback models. The issue might be related to the cloud function deployment, network connectivity, or the specific request parameters being sent.","Identified several potential loading issues: 1) The page expects defectAnalysis data to trigger prompt loading, but this might be missing or null. 2) The fetchStage1Prompt function has dependencies on virtue, defectAnalysis, and currentUserId - if any are missing, the prompt won't load. 3) Network issues with the cloud function endpoint. 4) The useEffect dependency array might cause issues with re-fetching. 5) The local file at /Users/bwenzlau/Projects/getstage1/index.js needs to be deployed to the cloud function URL.","Analyzed the connection between page and prompt. The key issue is that the React page calls a cloud function endpoint, but the user has the source code locally. The prompt won't load if: 1) defectAnalysis is null/missing, 2) The cloud function isn't deployed with the latest code, 3) Network connectivity issues, 4) Missing required request parameters. The fetchStage1Prompt function requires virtue, defectAnalysis, and currentUserId to be present before making the API call."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1759078959853"}
