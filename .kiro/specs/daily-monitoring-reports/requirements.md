# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated daily performance monitoring and alerting system that sends comprehensive email reports to administrators. The system monitors service health, usage metrics, and spending patterns, providing proactive alerts when thresholds are exceeded or anomalies are detected. This enables early intervention and maintains operational visibility across the application infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive daily performance reports via email, so that I can monitor the overall health and performance of the application without manually checking dashboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily report schedule triggers THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive performance report
2. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL send it via email to configured administrator addresses
3. WHEN the email is sent THEN it SHALL include service status, usage metrics, and spending data from the previous 24 hours
4. IF the email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the report is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL log the delivery confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive alerts for service issues, so that I can respond quickly to outages or performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service response times exceed 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL flag this as a critical alert
2. WHEN error rates exceed 5% over a 1-hour period THEN the system SHALL flag this as a high-priority alert
3. WHEN database connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL flag this as a critical alert
4. WHEN API endpoints return 5xx errors consistently THEN the system SHALL flag this as a high-priority alert
5. IF multiple critical alerts occur THEN the system SHALL escalate the alert priority to urgent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor usage metrics and trends, so that I can plan for capacity and identify unusual activity patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include daily active users count
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include total API requests and response time averages
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include database query performance metrics
4. WHEN usage increases by more than 50% compared to the 7-day average THEN the system SHALL flag this as a usage spike alert
5. WHEN usage decreases by more than 30% compared to the 7-day average THEN the system SHALL flag this as a potential issue alert
6. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include week-over-week and month-over-month trend comparisons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor spending and resource costs, so that I can control expenses and avoid unexpected charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include current daily spending across all services
2. WHEN daily spending exceeds the configured budget threshold THEN the system SHALL flag this as a budget alert
3. WHEN spending increases by more than 25% compared to the previous day THEN the system SHALL flag this as a spending spike alert
4. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include projected monthly costs based on current usage
5. IF projected monthly costs exceed the monthly budget THEN the system SHALL flag this as a budget projection alert
6. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL break down costs by service category (database, hosting, APIs, etc.)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure report settings and alert thresholds, so that I can customize monitoring to match our operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin panel THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration interface for report settings
2. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom thresholds for all alert types
3. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow adding or removing email recipients
4. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow enabling or disabling specific alert categories
5. WHEN settings are updated THEN the system SHALL validate all threshold values and email addresses
6. WHEN invalid settings are provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent saving

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the reports to be well-formatted and actionable, so that I can quickly understand the status and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the email report THEN the system SHALL use a clear, professional HTML template
2. WHEN alerts are present THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently with color coding (red for critical, yellow for warnings)
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include direct links to relevant admin dashboards for each alert
4. WHEN no alerts are present THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "All systems normal" status
5. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include a summary section with key metrics at the top
6. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL organize information in logical sections with clear headings
