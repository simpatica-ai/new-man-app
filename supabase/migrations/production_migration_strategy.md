# Production Migration Strategy: Organizational Model

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step production migration plan for implementing the organizational model in the virtue development platform. The migration transforms the existing sponsor-practitioner system into a comprehensive organizational structure while preserving all existing data and relationships.

## âœ… TESTING STATUS UPDATE

**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Status**: Monitoring scripts successfully tested on development database

### Tested Components:
- âœ… **monitoring_scripts.sql** - Successfully deployed and working on dev database
- ðŸ”„ **Migration scripts** - Ready for testing
- ðŸ”„ **Validation scripts** - Ready for testing

### Key Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **Reserved keyword conflicts** - Fixed `timestamp` â†’ `alert_timestamp`
2. **Missing database columns** - Made scripts adaptive to actual schema
3. **Supabase limitations** - Removed `pg_stat_statements` dependencies

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Real-world testing completed successfully

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation (1-2 days)

#### 1.1 Database Backup and Validation
```bash
# Create full production backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > production_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Validate backup integrity
pg_restore --list production_backup_*.sql | wc -l

# Test restore on staging environment
pg_restore -d $STAGING_DATABASE_URL production_backup_*.sql
```

#### 1.2 Data Analysis and Validation
- Count existing users and sponsor relationships
- Identify data inconsistencies or orphaned records
- Validate virtue progress data integrity
- Document current system state

#### 1.3 Staging Environment Setup
- Deploy migration scripts to staging
- Test complete migration process
- Validate rollback procedures
- Performance test with production data volume

### Phase 2: Schema Migration (30 minutes maintenance window)

#### 2.1 Apply Database Schema Changes
Execute migration scripts in order:
1. `20250103_organizational_model_schema.sql` - Core schema changes
2. `20250103_organizational_model_data.sql` - Data migration
3. `20250103_organizational_model_indexes.sql` - Performance indexes

#### 2.2 Create Default Organization
All existing users will be migrated to a default organization to maintain continuity:

```sql
-- Create default organization for existing users
INSERT INTO organizations (
  id,
  name,
  slug,
  primary_color,
  secondary_color,
  subscription_tier,
  max_users,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'Individual Users',
  'individual-users',
  '#5F4339',
  '#A8A29E',
  'legacy',
  1000, -- Higher limit for legacy users
  NOW()
);
```

#### 2.3 Migrate Existing Users
Transform existing user data to organizational model:

```sql
-- Update all existing users to belong to default organization
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  organization_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'individual-users'),
  roles = CASE 
    WHEN id IN (SELECT DISTINCT sponsor_id FROM sponsor_practitioner_relationships) 
    THEN ARRAY['coach']
    ELSE ARRAY['practitioner']
  END,
  is_active = true,
  last_activity = COALESCE(last_sign_in_at, created_at)
WHERE organization_id IS NULL;
```

#### 2.4 Migrate Sponsor-Practitioner Relationships
Convert existing sponsor relationships to coach assignments:

```sql
-- Create practitioner assignments from existing sponsor relationships
INSERT INTO practitioner_assignments (
  practitioner_id,
  supervisor_id,
  supervisor_role,
  organization_id,
  assigned_at,
  active
)
SELECT 
  spr.practitioner_id,
  spr.sponsor_id,
  'coach',
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'individual-users'),
  spr.created_at,
  true
FROM sponsor_practitioner_relationships spr
WHERE spr.active = true;
```

### Phase 3: Application Deployment (15 minutes)

#### 3.1 Deploy Application Changes
- Deploy new application code with organizational features
- Enable feature flags for organizational functionality
- Update API endpoints to support organization context
- Deploy updated UI components

#### 3.2 Verify Core Functionality
- Test user authentication and role assignment
- Verify existing sponsor dashboards work as coach dashboards
- Confirm practitioner access remains unchanged
- Test data isolation and permissions

### Phase 4: Post-Migration Validation (1 hour)

#### 4.1 Data Integrity Validation
Run comprehensive validation scripts to ensure:
- All users have organization assignments
- All sponsor relationships converted to coach assignments
- No data loss during migration
- Virtue progress data preserved

#### 4.2 Functional Testing
- Test existing user login flows
- Verify sponsor/coach dashboard functionality
- Confirm practitioner experience unchanged
- Test new organizational features

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (if issues detected within 1 hour)

#### Option 1: Database Rollback
```bash
# Stop application
kubectl scale deployment virtue-app --replicas=0

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL --clean production_backup_*.sql

# Deploy previous application version
kubectl set image deployment/virtue-app app=virtue-app:previous-version

# Scale back up
kubectl scale deployment virtue-app --replicas=3
```

#### Option 2: Feature Flag Rollback
```sql
-- Disable organizational features via feature flags
UPDATE feature_flags 
SET enabled = false 
WHERE flag_name IN ('organizational_model', 'multi_role_support');
```

### Extended Rollback (if issues discovered later)

#### Data Preservation Rollback
```sql
-- Preserve new organizational data while reverting core functionality
CREATE TABLE organizations_backup AS SELECT * FROM organizations;
CREATE TABLE practitioner_assignments_backup AS SELECT * FROM practitioner_assignments;

-- Revert profiles table changes
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN organization_id;
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN roles;
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN is_active;
-- ... (additional column removals)

-- Restore sponsor_practitioner_relationships if needed
-- (from backup data)
```

## Validation Scripts

### Pre-Migration Validation
```sql
-- Count existing users and relationships
SELECT 
  'Total Users' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Active Sponsor Relationships',
  COUNT(*)
FROM sponsor_practitioner_relationships 
WHERE active = true
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Total Virtue Progress Records',
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_virtue_progress;
```

### Post-Migration Validation
```sql
-- Verify migration completeness
SELECT 
  'Users with Organization' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM profiles 
WHERE organization_id IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Coach Assignments Created',
  COUNT(*)
FROM practitioner_assignments
WHERE supervisor_role = 'coach'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Users with Roles Assigned',
  COUNT(*)
FROM profiles 
WHERE roles IS NOT NULL AND array_length(roles, 1) > 0;

-- Check for data integrity issues
SELECT 
  'Orphaned Users' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM profiles 
WHERE organization_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Missing Role Assignments',
  COUNT(*)
FROM profiles 
WHERE roles IS NULL OR array_length(roles, 1) = 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Invalid Organization References',
  COUNT(*)
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON p.organization_id = o.id
WHERE p.organization_id IS NOT NULL AND o.id IS NULL;
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- User login success rate
- API response times for organizational queries
- Database connection pool usage
- Error rates in application logs

### Alert Thresholds
- Login failure rate > 5%
- API response time > 2 seconds
- Database CPU usage > 80%
- Application error rate > 1%

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Monitor application logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/virtue-app --tail=100

# Check database performance
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;"

# Monitor user activity
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as active_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM user_sessions 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"
```
